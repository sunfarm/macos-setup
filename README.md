# macos-setup
Setup a new Apple computer

### Install some applications with your mouse/trackpad
If you haven't used a Mac much, know that applications are often installed by dragging them to the Applications folder in your home directory from the disk image or .dmg file you download.

Home directory == `/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/` or `~/` or `$HOME`

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Better (but memory hogging) web browser (you'll probably want all web browsers though)

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) - Better terminal

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Package manager for MacOS

[Slack]()

#### App Store

Airmail

### Optional (for now)

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) - Deep macro/automation

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) - Secure tunnels to localhost

### Not free but worth every penny
These are highly recommended software. If you have used one of these, but found something better please let me know.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Fast **and** powerful text editor
VERY generous trial period situation (choose your own). Try using vim mode.
(I am currently using VS Code most of the time, but Sublime seems to always set the bar for fast and powerful)

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - External brain
There are other quality options, but this one serves my usage very well. Look into OmniFocus, Todoist, Any.do, there are a lot...

[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Automate anything
I use Hammerspoon for a number of automation tasks, but Keyboard Maestro just has so many features that it often comes through in a pinch. I also use the clipboard history and text expansion literally all the time. The UI is kinda lame and slow sometimes, but I don't know of a 1-to-1 replacement alternative.

### Install using the command line


[Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) - Replaces Spectacle; move/resize windows with your keyboard.

### Tips

Learn keyboard shortcuts for your OS and applications. Stop using your mouse/trackpad for everything. Your goal should be for your fingers to live on the [home row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing).

Use spotlight search (⌘ + Space). At least use this for opening applications or switching to them quickly.

[Remap CAPS LOCK](https://www.howtogeek.com/194705/how-to-disable-or-reassign-the-caps-lock-key-on-any-operating-system/) to something useful like Ctrl. CAPS LOCK is stupid as dirt and only gets in the way. If you're actually using it I would guess that [you're doing it wrong](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/youre-doing-it-wrong).

Navigate through applications and windows with these:
⌘ + Tab -- Switch open applications (hold down ⌘ to see them)
Ctrl + Tab -- Switch windows within the current application
⌘ + H -- Hide the current window (prefer this over minimizing)
⌘ + M -- Minimize the current window (if you absolutely must)
**Use Spectacle**

### Open iTerm

Run the following command to pull down this repo into `~/config/` and move into that directory

`git clone git@github.com:sunfarm/macos-setup.git ~/config && cd ~/config`

Run the installation script

`bash install.sh`

### Other stuff...

Install Homestead (along with VirtualBox and Vagrant)

@TODO: put the following in another place to keep this focused just on Mac setup.

If you don't have an Audible subscription, I also really think you should get one. If will give you something to do while driving or at the gym. If you don't commute and don't go to the gym, it will give you reason to go to the gym which will increase the length/quality of your career/life.
