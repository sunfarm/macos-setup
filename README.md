### Install some programs with your mouse/trackpad
If you haven't used a Mac much, know that programs are often installed by dragging them to the Applications folder in your home directory from the disk image or .dmg file you download.

Home directory == `/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/` or `~/` or `$HOME`
